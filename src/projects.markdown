## **Major Projects**
### [**libtmpl**](https://github.com/ryanmaguire/libtmpl)
`libtmpl`, *the mathematicians programming library*, is, among other things, a
full implementation of `libm`, the C standard library for mathematical
functions, and complex routines. These are the functions provided in
`math.h` and `complex.h`. It does this in a highly portable manner that does not
use any external libraries, and is compatible with C89, C99, C11, and C18
compilers. In addition to this it contains a plethora of
routines mathematicians and physicists may enjoy. This includes Fourier analysis
and FFTs, vector geometry, fresnel optics, knot theory, and more. It is
still a work in progress, but already contains over 160,000 lines of code.
### [**Mathematics-and-Physics**](https://github.com/ryanmaguire/Mathematics-and-Physics)
`Mathematics-and-Physics` contains all of my notes on mathematics and physics,
written in `LaTeX`. It also contains the code for several hundred figures,
written mostly in `asymptote`, but also in `tikz` and a few in `POV-Ray`.
### [**rss_ringoccs**](https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science/rss_ringoccs)
A suite of code for processing the radio science data from the Cassini mission.
Written in collaboration with Richard French, Jolene Fong, Glenn Steranka, and
Sophia Flury at Wellesley college.
